;this is to ensure that the code occupies entire sector and not just some parts for eg if you add it behind the bootloader you will see that it just takes up some bytes it does not fillup the sector, this is not good because it will cause lot of alignment issues,
; refer notes on alignment in /notes/alignment_text for detailed info
