PIT
the pit has 3 channels, and we usually use the channel0 
(IRQ0- IRQ 0X20)
to the program we talk to 

port 0x43: 	command/control port
port 0x40:	channel 0, where we send the divisor

PIT clock frequency
pit runs at a frequency of 1193182 hz
we pick a target frequency of 100hz
we choose 0x40  for sending the divisor
we can choose 0x41 or 0x42 we can select which port to send data by setting it up in the 0x43

so 0x43 expects the value of a byte out of that one byte
bit(7-6):select channel
	00:channel 0x40
	01:channel 0x41
	02:channel 0x42
bit(5-4):read/write
	00:low byte
	01:high byte
	11:low then high byte
bit(3-1):mode
	010: rate generator(recommeded for scheduling)
	011: square generator(also used somethimes)
bit(0):BCD
	0:16bit binary
	1:BCD 

in our current setup we use 
	channel 0(0x40) 00
	read/write	11
	mode		010
	binary		0
thereby getting a value of 
0011 0100= 0x34 
we send this to 0x43, and send the value to 0x40

regarding the value we send to 0x40
a pit counts 1193182 in a second if we want it to count only a 100times in a second ,we send 1193182/100 (how many 100hz in a second) it will only send an interrupt a 100 times in a second

so wha
