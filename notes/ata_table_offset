+0		data port	16-bit data read/write
+1		error/features  read:error,write:features
+2		sector count	number of sectors
+3		LBA low		bits 0-7 of lba
+4		LBA mid		bits 8-15 of lba
+5		LBA high	bits 16-23 of lba
+6		drive/head	master/slave bits24-27 of lba
+7 		command/stat	write:command read:status

there is a specific order or suggested order for moving values to ports

first drive/head base+6
second count to base+2
third fill lba values to base+3,base+4,base+5
at last set the command to base+7 
wait for bsy and drq once they are set as appropriate values
use a loop to read the number value from base
