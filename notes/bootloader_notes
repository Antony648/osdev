in this folder i am trying to create a mininmal operating system with 16 bit bootloader and 32 bit protected mode kernel
boot:
 we set the org values to 0x7c00
 as actual  bootloader gets loaded here in ram, and we use our bootloader to load the gdt to and jump to protected mode.
 this is a very simple bootloader in an advanced one, i would like to create a function to write a number of bytes form iso file to a location in ram, and so thereby write gdt ouside the bootloader, then load gdt to a point in ram(hardcoded predified) and then pass it to lgdt command.
but for now i am just  including it in my bootloader.
