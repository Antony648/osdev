devices send interrupts to pic (programmable interrupt controller), devices send irq 
to pic, there are 16 types. 0-7 are master and 8-15 are slave,
so irq 0-7 are send to pic , pic raises interrupts in range where we normally have other
system type exceptions and interrupts. so we have to remap them
we remap 0-7 irq to 0x20-0x27 and 8-15irq to int 0x28-0x2f  

master pic command port at 0x20
slave pic command port at  0xa0

master at 0x21
slave at 0xa1

we set port0x21 to interrupt 0x20
and port 0xa1 to interrupt 0x28

tell master and slave about each other

set master and slave back to 8086 mode


iwc1:
	set master and slave to init mode so we can remap them set up master-slave connection and put them to a 8086 mode
	mov		al,0x11
	out		0x20,al
	out 	0xa0,al
	
iwc2:
	now we remap 
	mov		al,0x20
	out		0x21,al		;mov 0x20 to port 0x21
	mov		al,0x28
	out		0xa1,al		;mov 0x28 to port 0xa1 
	
iwc3:
	; we pass a value to the master containing only a single bit one, the bit that is high corresponds 
	; to  say that  slave is at irq2 we need to set master to value 100b or 0x04
	mov		al,0x04
	out 	0x21,al
	
	;to set slave to irq2 we need to pass the value as such 
	mov		al,0x02
	out 	0xa1,al
	
iwc4:
	;set master and slave to 8086 mode
	mov		al,0x01
	out 	0x21,al
	out 	0xa1,al
	
in iwc1:
	we mov 0x11= 00010001b
	ic4:need ic4(1=yes)
	sngl: 1= single pic, 0=cascaded we need cascaded so 0
	adi: 0=8bytes, 1=4bytes ,we need 8bytes
	ltim:level triggered mode
	bit4:set to 0001 for iwc1
	
in iwc4:all same features as iwc1, but bit4 not set to zero so 0x01
